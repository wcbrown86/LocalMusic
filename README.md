## About This Project

Local Music is an idea to create a API and database of music events. The goal is to use this database to notify users of events close to them based off music preference and the users own music library. 

The secondary goal is to design a interface that venues can use to list there events on this database and use this information to show there events on the venues website. 

The users main interaction with the database would be through a mobile app that would pull the users music preference from there choice of music libraries, like Spotify and Apple Music. 

### What Is This Project For

The goal of this project is to allow me the creator to learn more about the full development process. I plan to use this to get a better handle on creating a project from start to finish. I will also focus on learning new concepts and practices. Like setting up testing for my code, and learning the Spring Framework for managing a database. 

This project is also meant to only be used to show my work and ability to learn new concepts and then apply these concepts into a working project.

#### Current Work being done. 
- [x] Design connection to LiveNation's Java API.
- [ ] Design connection with Java Spring to connect to SQL database.
- [ ] Implement tests to verify that the data is being pulled from the LiveNation API and then being stored in the LiveMusic database. 
- [ ] Design a simple user interface to be implemented on a smart phone and tablet.
- [ ] Implement user interface design and program a functioning iPhone app.
- [ ] Implement user interface design and program a functioning Android app.
- [ ] Design a simple user interface to be implemented on a web page to be used to allow venues and update and add events outside of LiveNation API.
- [ ] Design a program that will craw the web looking for venues and calendar events that are not apart of the LiveNation database. 
- [ ] Design web tool for venues to use as a calendar widget to show events on the venues webpage, this information will be used in the overall database to let users know about upcoming events. 
- [ ] Evaluate project in its current state to see if other functions or applications could be added to make the user experience better.

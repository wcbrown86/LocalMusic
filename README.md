## About This Project

Local Music is an idea to create a API and database of music events. The goal is to use this database to notify users of events close to them based off music prefreance and the users own music librarys. 

The secondary goal is to design a interface that venues can use to list there events on this database and use this information to show there events on the venues website. 

The users main interaction with the database would be through a mobile app that would pull the users music preferance from there choice of music libarays, like Spotify and Apple Music. 

### What Is This Project For

The goal of this project is to allow me the creator to learn more about the full deleopment process. I plan to use this to get a better handle on creating a project from start to finish. I will also focus on learning new conceps and pratices. Like setting up testing for my code, and learning the Srping Framwork for managing a database. 

#### Current Work being done. 
- [x] Design connection to LiveNation's Java API.
- [ ] Design connection with Java Spring to connect to SQL database
- [ ] Implement tests to verify that the data is being pulled from the LiveNation API and then being stored in the LiveMusic database.

Local Music is an idea to create a API and database of music events. The goal is to use this database to notify users of events close to them based off music prefreance and the users own music librarys. 

The secondary goal is to design a interface that venues can use to list there events on this database and use this information to show there events on the venues website. 

The users main interaction with the database would be through a mobile app that would pull the users music preferance from there choice of music libarays, like Spotify and Apple Music. 

Current Work being done. 
    * Currently working on learning test patterns for Python with pytest. 
    * Also building the backend work with Java so that once both are complete they
      can be compaired to see which will have a btter prefomace. 
    * Next step would be to work out the backend of the app to pull information from      existing sources like Livenation. 
    * Then once a source of infomation is set a database would need to be designed. 
    * Program native apps to access the database with the users information and           location. 
    * Work on building a webapp that venues can use to upload information directly. 
    * Work on other features that need to be designed once the main functionality is      set up.
